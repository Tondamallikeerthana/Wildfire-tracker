A real-time Wildfire Tracking Web Application built using React and Vite that visualizes active wildfire incidents on an interactive map. This project helps users monitor wildfire locations and understand environmental risk areas through map-based visualization.
Wildfire Tracker is designed to provide:
Interactive map-based wildfire visualization
Real-time fire location markers
Fire event information display
Simple and responsive user interface
The application fetches wildfire data from external APIs and displays it dynamically on a map.
